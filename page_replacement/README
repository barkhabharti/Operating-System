Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems
****************************************************

In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide
which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in.

Page Fault – A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual 
address space, but not loaded in physical memory.

Since actual physical memory is much smaller than virtual memory, page faults happen. In case of page fault,
Operating System might have to replace one of the existing pages with the newly needed page. Different page 
replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithms 
is to reduce the number of page faults.

Page Replacement Algorithms :

First In First Out (FIFO) –
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages 
in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the 
front of the queue is selected for removal.

Least Recently Used –
In this algorithm page will be replaced which is least recently used.

---------------------------------Problem ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You simulate some page-replacement algorithms and compare their
performances. Your simulations should be able to take in the required parameters from a data file in
the following format:

•The first line of the file contains two integers in this order: the number of pages in the reference
string, and the number of page frames.
•The rest of the file contains page reference string as a sequence of integers that are the page
numbers (in virtual address space) accessed by the process in sequence.

The simulator will simulate the behavior of the following page-replacement algorithms on the
reference string, andreport the number of page faults generated for each algorithm:
•FIFO
•LFU
•LRU

All the algorithms above are described in your text book. The simulator should take the following
command-linearguments (in this sequence): the name of the data file, a sequence of strings
(maximum three) from the following sets: FF, LF, LR (meaning the above three algorithms
respectively). The simulator simulates only the algorithms specified inthe command line. If no
algorithm is specified, all three are simulated.Submit the file page.c containing a main function, and
the implementation of the above three algorithms. Each of the algorithms should be implemented as
a separate function that is called from the main function.
